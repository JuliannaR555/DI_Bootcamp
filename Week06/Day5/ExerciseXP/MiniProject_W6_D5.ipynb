    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini-project, you will build a retrieval-based question-answering system using the llama_index library and HuggingFace models. Unlike the original setup using GPT-3.5-turbo via OpenAI, this project leverages open HuggingFace models such as TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 for text generation and sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will index a set of documents and query them using natural language prompts to extract structured and formatted answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load documents from a local directory using SimpleDirectoryReader  \n",
    "- Set up and configure HuggingFace LLM and embedding models  \n",
    "- Create a VectorStoreIndex with llama_index  \n",
    "- Persist and reload indexes from disk  \n",
    "- Query the index and retrieve well-structured outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- A document index from local PDF/text files  \n",
    "- A query engine capable of answering questions based on the indexed content  \n",
    "- A persisted index stored on disk for later use  \n",
    "- A set of responses to technical questions, demonstrating the system’s ability to summarize and format knowledge effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install required packages: llama_index, llama-index-llms-huggingface, llama-index-llms-huggingface-api, llama-index-embeddings-huggingface and vllm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import necessary classes: VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, Settings, HuggingFaceLLM and HuggingFaceEmbedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load documents (minimum 2 papers) into a directory called paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Initialize the LLM using TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model. Read about its documentation beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set up the embedding model using HuggingFaceEmbedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Apply models to global settings using Settings.llm and Settings.embed_model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create the index from documents using VectorStoreIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Persist the index to disk using index.storage_context.persist().\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Query the index with natural language prompts using query_engine.query().\n",
    "\n",
    "You can repeat this step with other queries such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a detailed summary of prompting techniques…  \n",
    "- What is fine-tuning of language models?  \n",
    "- Summarize the sparks of AGI paper…  \n",
    "- How can LLMs be used for recommendations in e-commerce?  \n",
    "- What are multi-modal embeddings and their applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you built a local document-based question-answering system using llama_index and HuggingFace models. You went through key steps like document ingestion, LLM configuration, index creation, storage, and querying. This workflow serves as a strong foundation for developing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems using open-source tools."

    "  - *What are multi-modal embeddings and how are they used?*\n",
