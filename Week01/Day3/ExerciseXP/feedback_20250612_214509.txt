suggestions for improvement:
- In `find_oldest_cat`, using a list comprehension could make the code slightly more concise.
- The comments in Exercise 2 could be improved for clarity and conciseness.  For example, instead of  `# Affiche un message indiquant que le chien aboie`, simply use `# Dog barks`. 
- In Exercise 4, the `sort_animals` method creates a new dictionary instead of modifying the existing `animal_groups` attribute.  While functional, directly updating `animal_groups` would be more efficient and maintain consistency. Consider using the `setdefault` method for adding to dictionaries to make this more efficient.
- Add docstrings to all functions to improve readability and explain their purpose and parameters.
